Steps1: Created a project using MFC library
Step2: Set up project configurations such as adding a libraries, adding additional dependencies, setting the output.arx file and so on
Step3: Set up the .def file which can access the acryx entrypoint which is the entrypoint of function 
Step4: Added required code inside pch.h file 
Step5: In .h of project file added required files and precompilation files 
Step6: In .h added the member function and entrypoint function outside class defination all methods to be included inside the .h 
Step7: In .cpp defination of the declaration of .h files
Step8: After creating this add the code intended to function save all files
Step9: In the configure select the debug option 
Step10: In the project properties inside general-Debugging->code->add the aced.h file path
Step11: Now open the solution inside autocad and then start debugging
Step12: Add breakpoints
Step13: Iterate over the breakpoints and see the results by stepping in out and so on
Step 14: Stop the debugging
Step15: Your application is ready for debugging
Step16: After the debugging now select the configuration to the release mode
Step17: Again do the configuration done at the start of application
Step18: Clean and rebuild the solution, your work is done
